## Build Your Free GPS Routing API with Python Flask 🗺️
*Build your free Distance Matrix API deployed on the cloud*

### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/build-your-free-gps-routing-api-to-calculate-road-distances-143632cc4917), we will create a free, easy-to-implement and customizable (and a bit slow :D) Distance Matrix API using Flask with a Selenium Bot deployed on Heroku

### How does it work?
Before starting to read this part, please forget everything you know about how to put in production a fast, efficient and stable code ensuring quick response with limited resources.
This will be simple, quick and dirty, with no intention to be a scalable solution. The performance will be way lower than if you directly query the official Google API — but here it’s free :)

#### Let us do it in three steps
1. Build a Selenium Bot that will query the distance from City A to City B in Google Maps Website
2. Set up your Flask API that will receive the request and return a distance
3. Deploy your code on Heroku

## Objective
This repository code can be used to build a visualization tool to apply the principles presented in this article.

## Code
This repository code should be used in the first step of analysis to duplicate the example found and render it using Python Flask.
1. Copy Github repository in your local folder and create a local python environment
2. Download libraries listed in requirements.txt
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch app.py
```
py app.py
```

## Next Steps
Communicate these visuals to your operations and marketing team to understand what drives your sales.
